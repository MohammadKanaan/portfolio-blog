## Overview
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={3} />

## Prerequisites

You need to have [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) installed. If you have the [Desktop App](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) for Windows or Linux you're good to go. 

## Preparing The Files

The docker compose file describes how an image is turned into a container. For this example I've chosen the **postgres:alpine** image as it saves space and memory. 

The container will expose to us port **6500** from port **5432**, the latter being the default for a running database. 

A volume will allow us to have persistence between runs.

The container will take its credentials from the **.env** file located in the same directory. That's why it's important to place this file at the root of your application.

Note: Make sure to change the container_name property if you're managing multiple databases to avoid naming conflicts.

```yaml:docker-compose.yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:alpine
    container_name: postgres
    ports:
      - '6500:5432'
    volumes:
      - progresDB:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    env_file:
      - ./.env
volumes:
  progresDB:
```

The **.env** file should include the following enviroment variables: POSTGRES_HOST, POSTGRES_PORT, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB. The **.env** file is usually located at the root of the application. Make sure to include it in the **.gitignore** file to avoid leaking sensitive information.

```javascript:.env
POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
POSTGRES_PORT=6500
POSTGRES_USER=[username]
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=[password]
POSTGRES_DB=[database_name]

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[username]:[password]@localhost:6500/[database_name]?schema=public"
```

## Running The Command

Finally we will run the following command to create the container. `-d` is shorthand for `--detached` which will allow us to run the container in the background and still use the command line.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Thank you for reading this far. I hope this guide helps you. Docker and PostgreSQL hold a special place in my heart!
