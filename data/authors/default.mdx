## About Me

I'm a motivated Computer Science undergraduate student from **Lebanon**. I started my journey at **13 years old**. I was discovering the world of **game development** with Unity game engine, and I fell in love with building games, and bulding software in general. I just knew I had to become a developer when I grew up. **And here I am!**

Nowadays you'll find me building **fullstack** **web** and **mobile** apps.
